The <B><I>"Z-100 LifeLine"</I></B> has been a bimonthly journal (6 issues per year) for Z-100 owners and vendors and is currently published by Steven W. Vagts. Due to personal demands, however, beginning in 2007 the publishing schedule was separated from the calendar and was no longer published every two months. Each issue would only be published when articles were ready (roughly every two to three months) or when necessary for the needs of the readers. As it turned out, due to personal reasons, there were some lengthy gaps of two years in publishing, but another issue was finally mailed out this October 2018! I've also nearly finished the inserts for the next issue which should be out within the next two months.<P>

The LifeLine serves as a communications vehicle to ensure readers have access to parts support and repair services, upgrade development and dissemination, and for problem resolution. Make me your sounding board if you have an issue with the Z-100.<P>

The <B><I>"Z-100 LifeLine"</I></B> was intended to fill the void left by the failing and now defunct original Users' Group Magazines - <B><I>"REMark"</I></B> and <B><I>"Sextant"</I></B> Magazines and <B><I>"CHUG"</I></B> (The Capitol Heath Users' Group) Newsletter. Other popular periodicals of the time included <B><I>"H-Scoop"</I></B> and <B><I>"BUSS"</I></B>, also now gone.<P>

<B>AFFILIATIONS:</B> This newsletter is strictly independent and has no connection with what remains of Zenith Data Systems or Heath Company. To my knowledge, it is the sole surviving newsletter for ANY Heath or Zenith Computer System!<P>

<B>NEWSLETTER INSERTS:</B> Nearly every issue contains inserts meant for installation in the User's Manual, Technical Manual, or Software/Hardware Manuals. Information in past issues have information on Repair, Maintenance, Hardware Modifications or Additions, Software Problems and Fixes, MS-DOS and Computer Upgrades, and Support Services.<P>

<B>BACK ISSUES:</B> Back issues of all "<I>Z-100 LifeLines</I>" are still available for $2.50 each. However, all issues are now available on CD-ROM. Each CD-ROM covers 30 issues (#1-30, #31-60, #61-90, and #91-present) in PDF format for $20.00 each and obviously requires a PC-compatible computer with a CD-ROM drive to access, read, or print the issues.<P> 
 
<B>FOR SALE/WANTED COLUMN:</B> All readers are entitled to free non-commercial "For Sale" or "Wanted" advertising for Z-100 related items. Any artwork must be camera-ready.<P>

<B>ARTICLE SUBMISSIONS:</B> Articles are highly encouraged, but must relate in some manner to the H/Z-100; i.e., software must be able to run on, or hardware must be installable on, the H/Z-100. Articles describing special uses of the H/Z-100 is of particular interest.<P>

<B>REPRINTS:</B> Commercial use reprints are approved on a case-by-case basis. Non-commercial use reprints of any issue is permitted as long as proper credit is given to the <B><I>"Z-100 LifeLine"</I></B>. Issues prior to issue number 31 (January 1994) were published by Paul F. Herman, Inc., 9317 Amazon Drive, New Port Richey, FL. Portions not specifically credited to other contributors were written by Paul and only he can approve commercial reprints of those issues.<P>

<B>LIABILITY:</B> Use of the material presented in the articles or of items purchased through the LifeLine or this web site is strictly <B>AT YOUR OWN RISK</B>. I cannot ensure the accuracy of the material presented, test the items on every configuration of the Z-100, nor do credit and background checks. However, I will make every effort to serve you any way possible!<P>

<B>REGISTERED TRADEMARKS:</B> Registered Trademarks are often used in the text here on the Web Site and in the Newsletter. In order to protect these trademarks, it is important to acknowledge them as the property of their respective companies. As many of these companies no longer exist, it is doubly important to recognize them for their important contribution to the computing world. For readability and space, Heath, Heathkit, H-89, H-90, H-100 (Heath Company), Zenith, Z-DOS, Z-89, Z-90, Z-100 (Zenith Corp.) IBM, IBM-PC, PC-DOS (IBM Corp.), MS-DOS, MultiPlan (Microsoft Corp.), CP/M (Digital Research), Gemini (Gemini Technology Inc.), EasyPC (UCI Corp.), Scottie Board (Scottie Systems), SuperCalc (Sorcim/IUS Inc.), dBASE xx (Ashton-Tate Inc.), WordStar (MicroPro International Corp.), Epson (Epson America Inc.) Panasonic, KXZ-Pxxxx (Panasonic Corp.), and others are so acknowledged, though specific references are not made in each occurrence. Thank you.<P>

<B>NOTICE:</B> The <I>"Z-100 LifeLine"</I> is now distributed free. Just drop me an e-mail with your address and phone number. Additional information, such as a description of your Z-100 and how you are using it would be nice, but not required. I will also continue to stock replacement parts. I have several Z-100 projects to keep me busy for many years to come. If you choose not to receive the LifeLine, each project's progress will also be reported here, though updating this website is laborious, time intensive, and often delayed, so please list this website as a 'Favorite' and refer back to it often. My e-mail and website addresses will continue unchanged.<P>

The <B><I>"Z-100 LifeLine"</I></B> maintains a <B>"Z-100 LifeLine Software Library"</B> that contains nearly 1,000 programs and routines covering every application ever submitted. Software is included from the original Users' Groups (including HUG, CHUG, and NOHUG), Paul F. Herman, and GernWare. As much as possible, the software is separated and saved to disk by application. While individual volumes are still available as usual, the entire library is now available on CD-ROM for $20.00. However, a PC-compatible computer with a CD-ROM drive is necessary to transfer the programs to a floppy drive format usable on the Z-100.<P>
