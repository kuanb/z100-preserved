Welcome to the Web version of the <B><I>"Z-100 LifeLine"</I></B>!<P>

I hope to use this page to bring newsworthy LifeLine items to your attention, so be sure to check this out periodically. Unless you've been receiving the LifeLine, you have probably been out of touch with the continuing changes in the Z-100 community. Some of these, I've mentioned elsewhere on this website, but not with much detail.<P>

My website now has several main pages, with their links to other pages given at the bottom of each page. These pages will probably remain relatively static.<P>

This page is where all the action will be. What's being worked on, who is doing the work, troubleshooting tips, and other noteworthy tid-bits. I hope to bring you the highlights of each issue of the LifeLine and, hopefully, encourage you to subscribe. We, the remaining proud owners of the Z-100, need your support.<P>

Please feel free to contact me if you have any specific comments or suggestions.<BR>
Now, the news:</FONT></TD></TR>

<B>The new <I>"Z-100 LifeLine"</I> IDE Controller Board, ZROM v4.3, and Z-DOS v4.06 has been shipped. There are only a few left, and once they are gone... they will be gone for good!!!</B><BR>
A product of the Z-100 LifeLine staff - John Beyers (software), Charles Hett (hardware), and I, the IDE Controller Board was an exciting project and the culmination of many years of hard work. The board enables use of IDE drives on the Z-100. The driving force behind this project was the need to replace the aging, and increasingly difficult to find, MFM hard drives for the Z-100. In addition, the board uses a 512Kb NVsRAM with Real Time Clock (RTC) to boot the computer, removing the need for boot code from the new hard drive, and has plenty of memory for speedy access to other programs. More information can be found at <A HREF="data/IDE.html">IDE</A>. And don't miss the article on the first operational IDE Controller in the Z-100 at <A HREF="data/Z100IDE.html">Z100IDE</A>.<BR>
There are a few extra boards remaining. If you are interested, contact me NOW!<BR>
The new Z-DOS v4.06 operating system (now on CD-ROM) and MTR-ROM v4.3 are also available separately.<P>

<B>A New Battery for the Z-100's SmartWatch Real Time Clock!</B><BR>
If you have not noticed, the SmartWatch is out of battery power by now!<BR>
Charles Hett wrote the article "Substitute Backup Battery for Dallas Semiconductor DS1216E Smartwatch" that we published in issue #124, August 2013, for just such a reason. I'll not publish the procedures here, for safety reasons. It involved grinding away the potting material on the underside of the clock module to disconnect the battery ground and installing a separate external battery, such as a CR2032 coin cell. However, I have since found that all my SmartWatch modules had two batteries, and while the modification will be further explained in the next issure of the LifeLine, I encourage you <B>NOT</B> to perform the modification until you have read the new update or contacted me.<P>

<B><I>"Z-100 LifeLine"</I> issue #126 was published in April 2016!</B><BR>
This issue took an exciting look at finding an LCD monitor for the Z-100, with full color photos. We ended up using three boards, the GBS-8200, the GBS-8219, and the GBS-8220 VGA Converters. While the results were successful for us, after much tweeking, others who have tried had less success. I'll need to revisit this issue in the future.<BR>

<B><I>"Z-100 LifeLine"</I> issue #127 was published in October 2018!</B><BR>
Yeah, I know - over two years from the last issue!! I have had a difficult time with my mother's health and could not find the time to do anything with Z-100s. Sorry.<BR>
Anyway, this issue, also in color, described a Z-120 "All-In-One" with an internal color CRT!! The machine was introduced to the Z-100 public at the first Z-100 Get-together in Norfolk, Virginia, way back in November, 1990! It did catch a paragraph in issue #10 of the <I>"Z-100 LifeLine"</I>, but then disappeared entirely, until it was offered to me this year. The brainchild of Lee Jones, Lee managed to fit the complete color system of a security monitor very neatly into a heavily modified Z-120 - an engineering marvel! I finally got to document the event as I think it should have been done.<BR>
In addition, we discuss the problems I had with the EasyPC and Gemini PC-emulator systems in that machine, and pass along a ZCLK (calendar/clock) Y2K software patch.<P>

It updated the SmartWatch mod mentioned above, provided greater details on a new ZCLK2 calendar clock board discussed a bit later, and discussed some of my efforts to work with the new Gemini ROM chips - another lively issue. You will not want to miss it.<P>

<B>The <I>Z-100 Lifeline</I> is now free!</B><BR>
The last several years have shown me that I can no longer stick to a publishing schedule - the work involved in researching a topic from every angle, then finding the time to publish the results has demanded a reallocation of resources, specifically, my time. So I've relieved myself of a publishing schedule, and will publish only when I have a subject worthy of your attention, and my time... hence the 30 months between issue #126 and #127. However, I hope you are pleased with the results - back to Z-100 basics and issues. If you do not already receive the LifeLine, e-mail me (link below) to get on the mailing list. That's all it takes.<P>

<B>A New ZCLK Calendar/Clock Board for the Z-100!</B><BR>
I mentioned SmartWatch and ZCLK earlier, and we obviously need a new clock calendar for the Z-100. After a brief search, I found that all the important parts of the ZCLK are still available. So I set about designing a new circuit board and have obtained three, so far. But let me first back up and briefly explain about the ZCLK.<BR>
The original ZCLK was manufactured in 1984 by FBE Research Company. It installed over the 68A21 Peripheral Interface Adaptor IC (U114) on the Z-100 motherboard, but it would interfere with the installation of the two most popular PC-emulators of the period, EasyPC and Gemini. A later model came with a short flat ribbon connector to offset the ZCLK away from the PC-emulator boards.<BR>
As I just mentioned, I've designed a new ZCLK2 with the ribbon cable and found all the necessary parts. I've already successfully tested all three boards and they look and work great. And the coin cell, the popular CR2032, can be replaced! The best part is that I can sell the boards for only $55.00 (includes the shipping costs), and I can order more, any time they are needed, for as long as the parts are available. Click on the images to see them more clearly. Please send me an e-mail (link below) if you are interested.<P>

The Jul-Aug 2003 issue has a complete, comprehensive index to <B><I>"Sextant"</I></B> articles covering issues 1 through 40, the last issue in March of 1989. While it contains a lot of H/Z-89 and PC material, the emphasis was placed on Z-100 material and articles of general interest. I'm sorry, but due to space limitations, very little material on the H-8 computer and other lesser known early hardware and software was included. I also left out robotics.

<B>HELP WANTED!</B><BR>
As I've announced many years ago, our software guru, John Beyers, has left <I>"Z-100 LifeLine"</I> rather suddenly and very unexpectedly. With us since the Z-100's early beginnings and well before my time, he has nearly single-handedly written or modified all the source code for this latest Z-DOS version, the last several monitor ROMs, and the LLSCSI and LLIDE Controller projects. He remains sorely missed and we wish him all the best in his future endeavors...<BR>
However, this has created a huge, very critical hole in our organization. I have been gradually trying to learn Assembly and make some sense of his programs, but this has been taking a huge amount of my time. <B>If you have Z-80 or 8080 assembly code experience, have lots of free time on your hands, and would like to opportunity to work for free</B>, we could sure use you. E-mail me below with any questions you may have.<BR>

<B>The <I>"Z-100 LifeLine"</I> has moved to Hendersonville, NC!!</B><BR>
I know this is old news to all of my regular readers, but anyone just visiting this site for the first time may still believe that I live in Elizabeth City, NC. On July 1, 2003, we moved from Elizabeth City to Hendersonville, North Carolina... and are very happy here.
